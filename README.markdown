# SyncMate

SyncMate is a little Applescript tool I conjured up to make my life easier when it comes to keeping my copy of TextMate the same between my machines.

The program is fairly unintelligent, but it work for basic needs.

# What SyncMate Does

Create a new file in your ~/Dropbox/ folder called .SyncMate (hidden from normal Finder view)
Copy your Preferences, Themes, Bundles, etc. from the computer to your Dropbox
Download those same Preferences, Themes, Bundles, etc. from the Dropbox to your local machine

# What SyncMate Cannot Do

SyncMate only works if you have Dropbox installed in its default ~/Dropbox/ location
SyncMate does not copy the TextMate.app file, so if you install a new GUI, etc. this will not carry over!

# How To Use SyncMate

Download
Run SyncMate
Choose "Save to Dropbox"
Wait a Minute
Done!

Make Sure TextMate is Not Running
Download On Another Computer
Run SyncMate
Choose "Update This Computer"
Wait a Minute
Done!

If you think eating a Tootsie Roll before trying to take down a bear gives you a fighting chance, I'm not coming to your funeral.  I'm looking at you, Captain Tootsie.
